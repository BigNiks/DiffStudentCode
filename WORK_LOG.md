| Feb 25 | 8:55-9:55 AM |               I spent this time in class just trying to brain storm some ideas on how to approach this problem. I had thought of a couple at first but then I quickly realized that I wasn't really considering dynamic programming in either solution. |
| Feb 26 |  1:55-3 PM   | After thinking about this problem some more, I realized that it had shared some similarities with our previous problem set heating up. In the sense that both are looking for the longest increasing sequence. With this in mind I tweaked my approach. |
| Feb 27 | 4:30-5:30 PM | I just spent this time attempting to code out my previous idea but running into issues with out of bounds errors once again. My mortal enemy. I feel like my code as it is feels like a natural stopping point before Mr. Blick reveals his hint to us. |
