| Feb 25 | 8:55-9:55 AM |                          I spent this time in class just trying to brain storm some ideas on how to approach this problem. I had thought of a couple at first but then I quickly realized that I wasn't really considering dynamic programming in either solution. |
| Feb 26 |  1:55-3 PM   |            After thinking about this problem some more, I realized that it had shared some similarities with our previous problem set heating up. In the sense that both are looking for the longest increasing sequence. With this in mind I tweaked my approach. |
| Feb 27 | 4:30-5:30 PM |            I just spent this time attempting to code out my previous idea but running into issues with out of bounds errors once again. My mortal enemy. I feel like my code as it is feels like a natural stopping point before Mr. Blick reveals his hint to us. |
| Mar 2  |   12-1 PM    | After learning the theory for this set, it seems very similar to making change. I spent this time today coding and finishing up the memoization approach, I plan to check in with Mr. Blick on tuesday so I can get some clarification on the tabulation approach. |
| Mar 4  | 8:55-9:30 AM |                                                                              I was able to finish up the tabulation approach in class after checking in with Mr. Blick. I already had a pretty good understanding of it but just wanted to make sure I understood. |
